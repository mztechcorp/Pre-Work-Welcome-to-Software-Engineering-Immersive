# Welcome to Software Engineering Immersive at MzTech

If you’re reading this, you’re on your way to becoming a software engineer. Congratulations! MzTech has prepared a pre-course learning experience to help you hit the ground running because, once you get into the classroom, things will move quickly. Let’s see what you have in store!

# The Journey to SEI

Our goal is to prepare you for Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) so you can make the most of the course starting on day one. There are two different parts in Software Engineering. Front-end & Back-end. Click the Link below and you can see our Path to become a Software Engineer.

# Step 1: MzTech Pre-Work

First, you’ll complete your pre-work here on the MzTech platform.

There are a lot of technical ideas to cover and terms to learn before beginning the in-class experience. To make sure you have the proper footing, we’ve prepared a learning path that covers the fundamentals of web-based programming, including HTML, CSS. You will also learn how to work with standard developer tools (the command line, Git, and GitHub).

Be sure to complete all assigned lessons before their deadline.

# Step 2: Readiness Assessment

Before your course officially begins, you’ll take the readiness assessment.

Once you’ve completed the pre-work, you’ll want to know which lessons sunk in and which you may need to revisit. This will help you to get your bearings and focus on the best way to make the most of the course.

# Step 3: The Course

Make sure you budget time for completing homework and projects outside of the classroom. Depending on their level of experience, students spend an average of 1–4 hours on assignments. So, expect to spend plenty of time outside of scheduled class hours working with your new skills.

Along the way, you’ll have plenty of support from your instructor, classmates and the rest of the MzTech staff.

# Pre-Work: What’s Covered

1. Intro to HTML || HTML Elements and Boilerplate
2. Intro to CSS || Color, Fonts, Classes and IDs, Images, Markup
3. Developer Tools || Terminal, File Systems, GitHub

# What Is CodePen?

CodePen is a communal digital sandbox — a website for testing and showcasing code snippets. It’s a great learning environment that provides an online code editor, a preview screen, and a gallery of work by other users. If you’ve never used CodePen before, take its tour.
To open your own [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) account:
Navigate to the CodePen website.
Select the “Sign Up for Free” button. You can register with an existing Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, or email account. Let’s use email.
Select “Sign Up with Email.” As prompted, enter your name, a username, your email address, and a password.
Hit the “Submit” button.
You’re good to go!

# What Is GitHub?

On GitHub, developers can share their code, comment on it, and review changes among one another. In a lot of ways, GitHub is like Dropbox.

To set up GitHub, so you can access course content in class, follow these steps:

Go to [GitHub](www.github.com) to join. Enter your username and email address, and click “Signup.”
This will create your account.
Note: Do this even if you already have a GitHub account! We’ll be using a version called “Github Enterprise,” which is separate from any GitHub account you’ve previously created.
If you’re new to GitHub, its website offers plenty of helpful guides and information. Review the Hello World guide to practice some basic GitHub actions or, if video is more your thing, watch Getting Started With GitHub on YouTube.

# Asking for Pre-Work Help

This pre-work will be challenging, and you may get stuck in some places. That’s OK! Professional developers get stuck all the time — the trick is learning to “un-stick” yourself. To help you get used to this process, here are the steps you should follow if you hit a roadblock:

Read (and then reread) what you’re being asked to do. Try explaining it to someone else in order to make sure you understand it. Alternatively, if your issue involves an error, read (and then reread) the error message carefully.
Reread the section from the beginning, taking notes as you go. Reading aloud can also help you notice if you’ve missed something.
Check with your fellow classmates in the #sei-fundamentals Slack channel; a similar question may have already been asked. Even if it hasn’t, you might find someone else stuck in the same place who can work through the issue with you.
Do a Google search to see if it helps point you in the right direction. Try not to be too vague (“my code doesn’t work”) or too specific (“what’s wrong with the following line of code: ‘...’”). Learning how to ask questions effectively is a valuable skill for a developer in training.
